Objective: Learn backbone basics!

Limitations: This tutorial is a singleton. I would like to learn how to create a webapp with
multiple classes to more easily arrange my css, js, and html.

Backbone is MVC -

User uses a controller, which manipulates a model, which updates a view, which shows the user what they want to see.

--------------
Models contain the interactive data and the logic surrounding it such as data validation, getters and setters,
default values, data initialization, conversions and so on.

--------------
Views glue together user events (clicks, pressed keys, etc.), render HTML views and templates,
and interact with models which contains the data of the application.

4 basic properties in a view:
    el - this.el is created from view's el, tagName, className, id, or attributes properties. If not specified, this
    el is an empty div. view.$el is a cached jQueary obj of the view's element

    initialize - pass parameters that will be attached to a model, collection, or view.el

    render - injects the markup into elements. Not all views require having a render f(), they can call other views'
    render functions

    events - i.e. {"<EVENT_TYPE> <ELEMENT_ID>": "<CALLBACK_FUNCTION>"}
            e.g. events: {'keypress #new-todo': 'createTodoOnEnter'}
            jQ e.g. $('#new-todo').keypress(createTodoOnEnter);

Every view must reference a DOM (Document Object Model), a representation of the html on the page as an object you can manipulate.

--------------
Controllers accpet input and convert it to commands for the model or view

--------------
Collections are ordered sets of models, where you can get and set models in the collection, listen for events when
any element in the collection changes, and fetching for modelâ€™s data from the server. Collections allows to save
data (in database, file, memory), and it requires a reference to it.

--------------
Routes match URL patterns to functions. YOU can use parameter parts such as "todos/:id" or using splats "file/*path"
you will match all the parameters from the splat on. A splat parameter should always be the last matcher.

CRUD - Give it/add to a template, register to a view by initializing, giving it an event, and a method
